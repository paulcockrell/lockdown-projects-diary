                            In my current job, we use Go and Elixir for our microservices. So I thought it best to keep up to speed with them
                            so I am productive on my hopeful return to work. And to be honest of the two I prefer Go hands-down so I have
                            ignored Elixir (as nice as it is...)

                            Here is my Top 3 list of the many books and tutorials I have worked through. There is an absolute tonne of stuff out
                            there so hopefully this list will be of use to someone that wants to explore Go too.

                            This is a fantastic place to start your journey with Go. Understand the TDD flow properly, while learning the fundamentals
                            of Go! This is extreemly well written, and by the end of it you build a small app that cements what you have learnt.

                            It is available for FREE, and in the format of a gitbook, and PDF/Mobi from the github repository.

                            This is a great book, guiding you through the construction of a real-world application built in Go. Armed with your basic
                            understanding of Go, (possibly from the TDD tutorial above) you build a production ready app, learning things such as
                            <ul>
                                <li>How to struct and organize your code</li>
                                <li>Security</li>

                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I enjoyed it so much, I went through the book twice. Just because I could ðŸ™ƒ

                        <p>
                            This is another wonderfully written book, it is not free, but my opinion is it is money well spent.
                            You really cannot go wrong with it.

                            Woah... what??? Yup, things are about to get heavy ðŸ¤˜
                        </h4>
                        <p>
                            This book will take you through the very complex world of blockchain, in possibly the most
                            hillarious tech book I've read so far. Lukas Lukac, the author has done a great job of condensing a very complicated
                            topic down to enough to get you up to speed on the topic. It's accompanied with a repo for you to see the evolution
                            of the program as you step through the scenarios that ultimately end up with a fully working blockchain implemented in Go.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This is not a code-along book, like the previous two, although it is littered with code snippets
                            (branches aligned with each chapter) conveying how things are to be implemented. You can run each branch locally and see it
                            in action of course.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I am 'coding along' but maybe I just like RSI in my wrists or something. But it really is extreemly interesting and
                            enlightening. Be warned, not for the faint-hearted, this is heavy stuff.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This is a paid-for book, but that get's you in direct contact with the author and the other students on a Discord server
                            which is great if you need anything expanding on.<br/>
                            There is a free introductory 7-chapter sample that you can follow, and then if you wish to continue follow the through
                            to his site to make the purchase.<br/>

                            This book will form my physical memory of the lockdown. It has been very theraputic with the escapism you get from creating your
                            own world and characters that you get to control.

                            Golang is great from my perspective. Learn the basics in an afternoon, and then crack on. Elixir is nice and all but I think simplicity will always win.

                            Creating a book is a good experience, and is way more technical than simply putting words to paper. I do think it's something everyone should give a go,
                            even if its simply putting all of your favorite photos into a small book at the end of the year.. It is nice to hold your book in your hands, and they
                            make great personal presents!
