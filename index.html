                            It's the spring of 20202, and the world has been put on lockdown, and neither Ironman nor Wonder woman turned up to save us all, which I think makes all those Marvel and DC documentaries misleading.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Well.. what am I to do now I'm furloughed for an unknown period of time??
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I decided to put the time to good use, and get stuck in with some light-hearted coding and
                            electronics projects.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Hopefully some of them make you smile, and others may inspire you to flex your creative
                            muscles and build your own amazing projects!

                            The first project I created was a Gameboy inspired Mario watchface. As this is a watch, it seemed like the best place to begin, and I always wanted to design
                            and create my own digital clock. This was inspired by an old 
                            <a href="https://github.com/paulcockrell/espruino-mario-clock" target="_BLANK" rel="noopener" alt="Espruino Mario Project">microcontroller
                            project</a> I did a few years back, which itself was inspired by a Mario watchface I had on my Pebble watch.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In a nutshell it is an animated watchface, where Mario is running through a level with random scenery, and when the time increments every minute, he jumps and hits the blocks that show the time.
                        </p>

                            This watchface is packed full of features, and I think the end result is quite splendid!

                        <h2>Day/night mode</h2>
                        <p>
                            We are all aware of the strain we put our eyes under with bright screens at night, so a dark mode was a must. It has three levels of darkness which
                            are cycled through by swiping left.

                            Mario is great, but we also love Toad and Daisy, so we have them all! To cycle through the characters you swipe the screen right. What ever is you choose is saved, so if you navigate to another app and return to this default watchface, your character will be selected automatically.

                            The screen is configured to use its lowest resolution - 80x80. This does not leave us with much space to display different information. So I implemented an information panel at the top of the watchface. This panel can show multiple peices of information by pressing button-1 on the watch, which cycles through the following:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Date</li>

                                <li>Phone connectivity (more on this later!)</li>

                            View information about the Sun and Moon, such as position in the sky, rise & set times and much more based

                        <p>
                            This little app is good fun if you like to know the times and technical terms and phases the Sun and Moon go through, for the present day. Such as the current moon phase, the position of the Sun and moon in respect to the earth and so on.
                            The maths that drives this came from the <a href="https://github.com/mourner/suncalc" alt="Suncalc library" target="_BLANK">Suncalc</a> library that was slightly modified to run on the BangleJS (and some issues corrected). I am in no way clever enough for this sort of maths, what I really did was add a nice watch-friendly
                            display over the top of it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When it boots it reads your GPS position (or you can skip this if you have a previous GPS lock), and then presents a menu for you
                            to navigate through to learn about the Sun and Moons details for today.

                            A clock face simulating the classic dotmatrix displays. Shows time, date, compass, and heart rate.

                            This is a basic watchface with nothing too fancy going on. I just like bulky graphics I suppose, and wanted to produce a simple static display that was pleasing to the eye.
                            It emulates the lovely white-on-blue LCD displays.

                            Home IOT project using Arduinos to record environmental readings
                        </p>
                        <aside>
                            The most important thing I learnt from this spike was to use <a href="https://platformio.org/" alt="PlatformIO" target="_BLANK">PlatformIO</a> VSCode plugin for development. Typically you use the (very) basic Arduino editor which offers no help. The PlatformIO plugin is simply amazing, offering all the common modern IDE features, and helps you to write and run <b>unit tests</b> for your arduino projects!
                        </aside>
                        <h3>Project summary</h3>
                        <p>
                            This was more of a spike to see what I can do with the electronics components I had lying around in various boxes.
                            I wanted to see if I could setup some sort of simple wireless environmental sensor network and have the data consumed and published up to Google IOT services for storage and presentation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I searched the internet for tutorials doing this sort of thing, and after combining them together I ended up with this functioning project.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Hardware</h3>
                        <p>
                            I found the impressive esp8266 wireless module and a few Arduino Nanos, some HC12 transievers and a couple DHT11/22 sensors. This appeared to be all I needed to get the project started.
                            So to begin with I needed a 'hub' to which all the remote wireless sensors would transmit the sensor data to, and in turn was connected to the internet.
                            This was ideal for the esp8266 module, to which I connected a HC12 transiever.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Cloud setup</h3>
                        <p>
                            The next step was to write some code that connected the device to my home wireless network and authenticate with Google IOT. This required all the necessary provisioning of services on Google Cloud, such as:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    IOT Core
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    MQTT Pub/Sub
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <h3>Construction</h3>
                        <p>
                            Now that the esp8266 was on the network and authenticated and communicating with Google IOT services it was time to make the remote sensors. These were simple to setup, just connect an Arduino Nano to a DHT11 sensor (which collects temperature and humidity) and the HC12 wireless module.
                            It is important that all the HC12 modules are opperating on the same channel, baud rate etc. I chose configuration 'FU4' which is for long range comms, these settings are configured using AT commands through a serial connection.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With the sensors transmitting data, and the hub device collecting and publishing them to the message queue on Google, it was time to process, store and render the data!
                        </p>

                            I used Googles Firebase for this step. In here I created a serverless-function to process the messages that come in on the message queue, and persist them to the real-time database I setup.
                            With the messages persisted, I then put together a simple webpage (hosted in Firebase) to render a section of the latest data in graphs.

                        <p>
                            This was a nice little project, that had its learning curves i'll be honest, especially when it comes to the HC12's.. they can be very fussy in their physical setup to get working, such as aerials types, aerial position and orientation, distance etc.
                            There are plenty of tutorials on doing projects just like this, I usually head over to <a href="https://www.instructables.com/" alt="Instructables" target="_BLANK">Instructables</a> which has many great projects for you to follow.

                            Sacred Geometry is really fascinating, and the pictures you produce are exceptional.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After doing a lot of coding after the first four weeks of lockdown, I needed to take a break and decompress. I was working more hours than I would at work, and also working seven days a week.. It was hard to stop I was enjoying it all so much.
                            But still I decided to relax with some drawing, in particular some Sacred Geometry. It is very theraputic, as all you need is a compass, ruler, and a pen. No artistic skills need for this!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            What makes this way of drawing special is that the pictures are mathematically perfect, everything is a ratio of something else you draw before-hand. You can only create distances by existing line intersections. You have to watch a video of one being drawn to understand what I mean.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I found this fantastic channel on Youtube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUfc5V23Oy_XD99LHYPvp4Q" alt="Dearing Wang" target="_BLANK">Dearing Wang</a> that is full of timelapse videos of the art being drawn, that you can follow along to.

                        </aside>
                        <h3>Completed drawing</h3>
                        <p>It took three days, dipping in and out of the drawing. And I also did some of my own patterns as part of experimentation.</p>

                            I am left handed, and there are only a couple languages in the world that have a script that is written from right to left.
                            This is intruinging to me and wanted to see if it felt more natural to write this way (my assumption was yes).
                            So I picked Farsi (Persian) which is an Indo-European language, which means it has all the familiar sounds like in English,
                            but it uses a variant of the Arabic script, which is written from right to left, and exceptionally beautiful.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I completed the book and I have to say it is fantastic, I have many other books but I get lost in the gramar and unfamiliar script and words.
                            This just teaches you the alphabet and gives you the ability read words (even if you don't know their translation). It is a great place to start.

                            I have loved the concept of the Stirling engine since before I even had a beard. You may have come accross one before, the classic images is to have one run on the difference between the ambient temperature and the heat from a cup of tea.

                            I love the idea of these engines, and think they deserve much more investigation as a potential way of converting the energy the sun hurls at us in to mechanical energy.
                            What I dislike about them is they are very bulky with wheels and rods etc, which I guess doesn't make them very practical in real life. So I went on to design a more compact implementation, more like an electric motor configuration.
                            I used <a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/" alt="Tinkercad" target="_BLANK">Tinkercad</a> which is an online 3D drawing program, which exports the designs for 3D printing.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I had actually started this project many many years ago, and this engine has been through countless itterations. But during the start of the lockdown I finally got to a point
                            where I think I am close to getting a working design.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After finishing the designs I printed the parts out on my 3D printer (a CELRobox) and put it together. Although it works mechanically speaking, it doesn't run under the
                            temperature differences as desired. I think this is down to various factors, the most important one being the size difference of the power piston and the displacement piston.
                            So I will have to go back and redesign, and reprint.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I have classified this project as top-secret, I don't think there is an engine in the world that has this configuration. So if you are Sir James Dyson, or an actual engineer, I would love to
                            hear from you and finally get this engine made properly, and out making the lives of other people better.
