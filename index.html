                            So the world has been put on lockdown, and neither Ironman nor Wonder woman turned up to save us all, which I think makes all those Marvel and DC documentaries misleading.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Well.. what am I to do now I'm furloughed for an unknown period of time??
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I decided to put the time to good use, and get stuck in with some light-hearted coding and
                            electronics projects.
                        </p>

                            Hopefully some of them make you smile, and others may inspire you to flex your creative
                            muscles and build your own amazing projects!

                            It's a fantastic watch that is exreemely easy to develop apps for. You write your apps in Javascript, directly in the browser, and load into the watch
                            wirelessly over bluetooth.

                        <p>
                            The first project I created was a Gameboy inspired Mario watchface. As this is a watch, it seemed like the best place to begin, and I always wanted to design
                            and create my own digital clock. This was inspired by an old 
                            <a href="https://github.com/paulcockrell/espruino-mario-clock" target="_BLANK" rel="noopener" alt="Espruino Mario Project">microcontroller
                            project</a> I did a few years back, which itself was inspired by a Mario watchface I had on my Pebble watch.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In a nutshell it is an animated watchface, where Mario is running through a level with random scenery, and when the time increments every minute, he jumps and hits the blocks that show the time.
                        </p>
                        <div class="post-images pure-g">

                        <p>
                            This watchface is packed full of features, and I think the end result is quite splendid!
                        </p>
                        <h2>Day/night mode</h2>
                        <p>
                            We are all aware of the strain we put our eyes under with bright screens at night, so a dark mode was a must. It has three levels of darkness which
                            are cycled through by swiping left.

                        <h2>Multiple characters</h2>
                        <p>
                            Mario is great, but we also love Toad and Daisy, so we have them all! To cycle through the characters you swipe the screen right. What ever is you choose is saved, so if you navigate to another app and return to this default watchface, your character will be selected automatically.

                            The screen is configured to use its lowest resolution - 80x80. This does not leave us with much space to display different information. So I implemented an information panel at the top of the watchface. This panel can show multiple peices of information by pressing button-1 on the watch, which cycles through the following:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Date</li>
                                <li>Battery level</li>
                                <li>Temperature</li>

                            View information about the Sun and Moon, such as position in the sky, rise & set times and much more based
                            on your GPS position and date.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This little app is good fun if you like to know the times and technical terms and phases the Sun and Moon go through, for the present day. Such as the current moon phase, the position of the Sun and moon in respect to the earth and so on.
                            The maths that drives this came from the <a href="https://github.com/mourner/suncalc" alt="Suncalc library" target="_BLANK">Suncalc</a> library that was slightly modified to run on the BangleJS (and some issues corrected). I am in no way clever enough for this sort of maths, what I really did was add a nice watch-friendly
                            display over the top of it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When it boots it reads your GPS position (or you can skip this if you have a previous GPS lock), and then presents a menu for you
                            to navigate through to learn about the Sun and Moons details for today.

                            You will want to set your own starting weight values for your 5x5 training program. To do this is easy! After installing this app, go to the BangleJS app store, connect to your watch, and navigate to the <code>My Apps</code> tab. In there you will find this app in the list, and an icon (a down arrow) to the right of the app title. Click that icon to reveal a configuration page. Enter your weights and other details, and click upload. That is it, you are now ready to train!

                            <li>At the top is the exercise name, e.g &#39;Squats&#39;</li>
                            <li>Next is the weight you must train</li>
                            <li>In the center is where you record the number of <em>reps</em> you completed (more on that shortly)</li>
                            <li>Below the <em>reps</em> value, is the target reps you must try to reach.</li>
                            <li>Below the target reps is the current set you are training, out of the total sets for the exercise.</li>
                            <li>The <em>reps</em> value is used to store what you achieved for the current set, you enter this after you have trained on your current set. To alter this value, use BTN1 to increase the value (it will stop at the maximum required reps) and BTN3 to decreas the value to a minimum of 0 (this is the default value). Pressing BTN2 will confirm your reps</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>Rest timers</h3>
                        <p>
                            You will then be presented with a rest timer screen, it counts down and automatically moves to the next exercise when it reaches 0. You can cancel the timer early if you wish by pressing BTN2. If it is the last set of an exercise, you don&#39;t need to rest, so it lets you know you have completed all the sets in the exercise and can start the next exercise.

                            I am left handed, and there are only a couple languages in the world that have a script that is written from right to left.
                            This is intruinging to me and wanted to see if it felt more natural to write this way (my assumption was yes).
                            So I picked Farsi (Persian) which is an Indo-European language, which means it has all the familiar sounds like in English,
                            but it uses a variant of the Arabic script, which is written from right to left, and exceptionally beautiful.
